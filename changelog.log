= v2.0.2 (13/06/2016) =
* Features
	- Rollout to Peru. This plugin is now supporting Peru, which includes Basic Checkout, Custom Checkout, Tickets, and local language translations.
* Bug fixes
	- Fix a PHP version issue. It was reported to us an issue in a function that uses an assign made directly from an array field. This feature is available in PHP 5.4.x or above and we've made an update to support older versions;
	- Fix a tax issue. It wasn't been correctly added to the total value in Mercado Pago gateway.

= v2.0.1 (09/06/2016) =
* Features
	- Customer Cards (One Click Payment). This feature allows customers to proceed to checkout with only one click. As Mercado Pago owns PCI standards, it can securely store credit card sensitive data and so register the customer card in the first time he uses it. Next time the customer comes back, he can use his card again, only by inserting its CVV code. Want to see how it works on-the-fly?

* Improvements
	- SSL verifications for custom checkout and ticket. Custom Checkout and Ticket solutions can only be used with SSL certification. As the module behaves inconsistently if there is no SSL, we've put a watchdog to lock the solution if it is active without SSL;
	- Enabling any type of currency without disabling module (now, error message from API). Now, merchants have the option to use currencies of their choices in WooCommerce. Pay attention that Woo Mercado Pago will always set the currency related to the country of the Mercado Pago credentials.

	- Fixed status change when processing with two cards. When using payments with two cards in Basic Checkout, the flow of order status wasn't correct in some cases when async IPN events occurs. We've made some adjustments to fix it.
